<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>poloLender Pro is an automatic bot which lends funds on Poloniex exchange.</p>
<p>The lending rate is calculated using  statistical calculation in order to maximize profits.</p>
<p>poloLender Pro does not calculate the lending rate itself, instead the poloLender Pro receives the lending rate from <strong>poloLending-Advisor</strong> server.
    <strong>poloLending-Advisor</strong> is an on-line server hosed at <a href="http://safe-hollows.crypto.zone" title="http://safe-hollows.crypto.zone">http://safe-hollows.crypto.zone</a>.</p>
<p>In order to calculate optimal lend offer rate, the server continuously monitors the lend-book (active offers) and also calculates the average loan holding time.
    Based on this data and using statistical calculation <strong>poloLending-Advisor</strong> server can inform poloLender Pro clients of the rate with best profit returns.</p>
<p>By using historical information and statistical calculation poloLender Pro is able to give better return rates, as comparing with placing offers only looking at a snapshot of the lend book.</p>
